# HTBWalkthroughs
Hello and welcome to my walkthroughs for Hack the Box (HTB). I've challenged myself with completing 50 HTB machines over the course of 6 months to learn hacking tools and skills that will prepare me for a career in the field. Being that I am very much a beginner at the time of writing this, I won't be able to solve any machine without guidance at first, so my plan is as follows:

1. The first 10 machines I will do with the help of other write-ups and tutorials (I will attach links to any resources I use at the bottom of each of my walkthroughs). The goal here is to learn the basic tools and skills used in pentesting.
2. The next 15 machines I will attempt to with as little help from other tutorials and write-ups. I will have them open and available but use them only as clues for what I should research to get to the next step. The goal here is to practice problem solving and methodology without direct guidance.
3. The final 25 machines I will attempt to do without tutorials or write-ups, giving me a more realistic feel for how field tests may be.

# Set Up
I will be using Kali Linux and many of its tools to complete the machines. Unless you want to dual boot or reset the OS of your computer, I would recommend following [these instructions](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/how-to-install-kali-linux-on-virtualbox/) to set it up on your own device. (It's totally free and has plenty of documentation if you come across an issue that isn't in that link)

I will also be using many of the tools in Kali Linux to complete the boxes. I will make sure to mention any programs or software that I use in my write-ups. To find any of them in Kali Linux, go to the **Applications** tab on the top left of the window and there will be a dropdown of all of the tools and programs it offers

For [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), you will need to subscribe as a VIP member (its about $13 a month) and with it you will have access to all the retired boxes as well as a bunch of other features I'm still exploring. After signing up, it was a bit confusing for me to set up the VPN to be able to access the challeneges, so [this website](https://steemit.com/ethicalhacking/@rahul516/how-to-connect-to-hack-the-box-vpn) will show you how to set up the VPN to access the challenges (you'll have to figure out how to get an invite code yourself ;) )

# DISCLAIMER
As I've said, I am a beginner, and as such there is a very good chance I will explain things wrong or take a longer roundabout way than is neccessary. As I learn more I will do my best to go back and edit any past mistakes. If you catch anything or have a better method, feel free to message me on twitter [@s0merset7](https://twitter.com/s0merset7)
